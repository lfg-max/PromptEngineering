The taste was exquisite and I would recommend this to anybody who plans to visit this outlet. I could come here just to have that Pizza.

       "1  Kailash colony is brimming with small cafes now. I happened to visit this beauty for lunch and was amazed with the 1st impression it made.  We started with Falafel & Pita and Margherita Pizza. Safe to say, Margherita pizza was the best choice of the day. Its made freshly in front of you in the Wood Fired oven. The taste was exquisite and I would recommend this to anybody who plans to visit this outlet. I could come here just to have that Pizza. Hummus, Pita and Falafel were a good side dish while we ordered the next couple of dishes. We moved on to order Fussili Alfredo. This white sauce fussili pasta was good but could not be compared to the pizza we had earlier.  In the end, we went for Frozen Yoghurt with Honey. It is recommended to have it with honey, which will do wonders to the frozen yoghurt!  This place turned out to be quite peaceful and the plants enhanced its beauty.   \n",

The ambience is very pure and gives a sense of positivity throughout. Outdoor and indoor interior are quite quaint and cute. Love the open kitchen idea and there whole marketplace ideology. Due to coronovirus they specifically use disposable cutlery to keep the pandemic in mind taking all the precautionary measures from the beginning of the place with the mask on their staff and using good sanitisation. The food is really amazing specially the pizza straight from the oven and the hummus and pita bread are quite delicious too.

       "1  Kailash colony is brimming with small cafes now. I happened to visit this beauty for lunch and was amazed with the 1st impression it made.  We started with Falafel & Pita and Margherita Pizza. Safe to say, Margherita pizza was the best choice of the day. Its made freshly in front of you in the Wood Fired oven. The taste was exquisite and I would recommend this to anybody who plans to visit this outlet. I could come here just to have that Pizza. Hummus, Pita and Falafel were a good side dish while we ordered the next couple of dishes. We moved on to order Fussili Alfredo. This white sauce fussili pasta was good but could not be compared to the pizza we had earlier.  In the end, we went for Frozen Yoghurt with Honey. It is recommended to have it with honey, which will do wonders to the frozen yoghurt!  This place turned out to be quite peaceful and the plants enhanced its beauty.   \n",

Hotel staff seems very professional specially the team at front desk although I was not staying there but they helped me with few of my quarries. Was dining with my kids and the team member at front desk young guy came with some kids book and gave it to my little child. It was a wonderful experience at Holiday inn and the staff was super . I was little worried as using the hotel first time for dining but the staff made it more comfortable. Will strongly recommend this and special thanks to people working at desk do not remember his name but he was a manager in the lobby who suggested us kylin for food and thanks to him that we enjoyed meal at kylin and now it's my first choice for food.   \n",

The ambience is very pure and gives a sense of positivity throughout. Outdoor and indoor interior are quite quaint and cute. Love the open kitchen idea and there whole marketplace ideology. Due to coronovirus they specifically use disposable cutlery to keep the pandemic in mind taking all the precautionary measures from the beginning of the place with the mask on their staff and using good sanitisation. The food is really amazing specially the pizza straight from the oven and the hummus and pita bread are quite delicious too. If you're looking for a classy yet soothing Italian place in Delhi,Fatjar is a go to for you!   \n",
       "1  Kailash colony is brimming with small cafes now. I happened to visit this beauty for lunch and was amazed with the 1st impression it made.  We started with Falafel & Pita and Margherita Pizza. Safe to say, Margherita pizza was the best choice of the day. Its made freshly in front of you in the Wood Fired oven. The taste was exquisite and I would recommend this to anybody who plans to visit this outlet. I could come here just to have that Pizza. Hummus, Pita and Falafel were a good side dish while we ordered the next couple of dishes. We moved on to order Fussili Alfredo. This white sauce fussili pasta was good but could not be compared to the pizza we had earlier.  In the end, we went for Frozen Yoghurt with Honey. It is recommended to have it with honey, which will do wonders to the frozen yoghurt!  This place turned out to be quite peaceful and the plants enhanced its beauty.   \n",

We started with Falafel &amp; Pita and Margherita Pizza. Safe to say, Margherita pizza was the best choice of the day. Its made freshly in front of you in the Wood Fired oven. The taste was exquisite and I would recommend this to anybody who plans to visit this outlet. I could come here just to have that Pizza. Hummus, Pita and Falafel were a good side dish while we ordered the next couple of dishes. We moved on to order Fussili Alfredo. This white sauce fussili pasta was good but could not be compared to the pizza we had earlier.  In the end, we went for Frozen Yoghurt with Honey. It is recommended to have it with honey, which will do wonders to the frozen yoghurt!  This place turned out to be quite peaceful and the plants enhanced its beauty.</td>\n",

Due to coronovirus they specifically use disposable cutlery to keep the pandemic in mind taking all the precautionary measures from the beginning of the place with the mask on their staff and using good sanitisation. The food is really amazing specially the pizza straight from the oven and the hummus and pita bread are quite delicious too.

We started with Falafel &amp; Pita and Margherita Pizza. Safe to say, Margherita pizza was the best choice of the day. Its made freshly in front of you in the Wood Fired oven. The taste was exquisite and I would recommend this to anybody who plans to visit this outlet. I could come here just to have that Pizza. Hummus, Pita and Falafel were a good side dish while we ordered the next couple of dishes. We moved on to order Fussili Alfredo. This white sauce fussili pasta was good but could not be compared to the pizza we had earlier.  In the end, we went for Frozen Yoghurt with Honey. It is recommended to have it with honey, which will do wonders to the frozen yoghurt!  This place turned out to be quite peaceful and the plants enhanced its beauty.</td>\n",

The ambience is very pure and gives a sense of positivity throughout. Outdoor and indoor interior are quite quaint and cute. Love the open kitchen idea and there whole marketplace ideology. Due to coronovirus they specifically use disposable cutlery to keep the pandemic in mind taking all the precautionary measures from the beginning of the place with the mask on their staff and using good sanitisation. The food is really amazing specially the pizza straight from the oven and the hummus and pita bread are quite delicious too. If you're looking for a classy yet soothing Italian place in Delhi,Fatjar is a go to for you!   \n",
       "1  Kailash colony is brimming with small cafes now. I happened to visit this beauty for lunch and was amazed with the 1st impression it made.  We started with Falafel & Pita and Margherita Pizza. Safe to say, Margherita pizza was the best choice of the day. Its made freshly in front of you in the Wood Fired oven. The taste was exquisite and I would recommend this to anybody who plans to visit this outlet. I could come here just to have that Pizza. Hummus, Pita and Falafel were a good side dish while we ordered the next couple of dishes. We moved on to order Fussili Alfredo. This white sauce fussili pasta was good but could not be compared to the pizza we had earlier.  In the end, we went for Frozen Yoghurt with Honey. It is recommended to have it with honey, which will do wonders to the frozen yoghurt!  This place turned out to be quite peaceful and the plants enhanced its beauty.   \n",

Hotel staff seems very professional specially the team at front desk although I was not staying there but they helped me with few of my quarries. Was dining with my kids and the team member at front desk young guy came with some kids book and gave it to my little child. It was a wonderful experience at Holiday inn and the staff was super . I was little worried as using the hotel first time for dining but the staff made it more comfortable. Will strongly recommend this and special thanks to people working at desk do not remember his name but he was a manager in the lobby who suggested us kylin for food and thanks to him that we enjoyed meal at kylin and now it's my first choice for food.   \n",
